/**
 * A DataTableReader allows iteration over summary or underlying data by pages.
 * The page size is established when the DataTableReader is created.
 * (See getLogicalTableDataReaderAsync, getSummaryDataReaderAsync, or getUnderlyingTableDataReaderAsync.)
 * The normal sequence of operations would be to
 * 1. Create the DataTableReader for the desired DataTable.
 * 2. Use DataTableReader.totalRowCount or DataTableReader.pageCount to discover how many rows or pages are in the desired DataTable.
 * 3. Call DataTableReader.getPageAsync() to get the page(s) desired. Each page is a DataTable for that page.
 *    Alternatively, based on the DataTableReader.totalRowCount, DataTableReader.getAllPagesAsync can be used to fetch the entire DataTable.
 * 4. Call DataTableReader.releaseAsync() to free up resources.
 *
 * Notes for usage of a DataTableReader:
 * 1. Since DataTableReaders consume server resources, an inactive DataTableReader will be automatically
 *    released after 60 minutes of inactivity. (A new DataTableReader can be created at that time, if needed.)
 * 2. Calling getPageAsync() after an explicit or automatic releaseAsync() will throw an exception.
 * 3. Only one active DataTableReader per logical table id is supported.
 * 4. There are still limits on the number of rows supported for underlying and logical data table readers.
 *    The default limit is approximately 1 million rows of data for getUnderlyingTableDataReaderAsync,
 *    and approximately 32 million cells (rows * columns) for getLogicalTableDataReaderAsync.
 *    Administrators may change these limits to better match computing resources with the Tableau Server (Cloud) or Tableau Desktop options:
 *    ExtensionsAndEmbeddingReaderRowLimit for getUnderlyingTableDataReaderAsync or
 *    ExtensionsAndEmbeddingReaderCellLimit for getLogicalTableDataReaderAsync.
